## About

Hi, I'm Amina! With an analytical background in Economics and a recent graduate of Boston University's Applied Data Analytics Program, I have developed a robust foundation in data science and advanced analytical techniques.

Iâ€™m passionate about exploring innovative tools and methodologies in data analysis, continuously seeking opportunities to enhance my skills. Whether collaborating with a team or working independently, I thrive on uncovering meaningful insights and applying data-driven solutions to tackle complex problems.

This repository is a space where I showcase my skills, share projects, and document my journey in the fields of Data Analytics and Data Science.

### Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie
**Code:** [Dota 2 Winner Prediction (Binary Classification Problem)](https://github.com/amina042297/amina042297/blob/main/Dota%202%20Winner%20Prediction%20(Binary%20Classification%20Problem).ipynb) 

**Goal:**
To predict the winner (Radiant or Dire) in a Dota 2 game based on in-game statistics from the first few minutes of gameplay using machine learning models.

**Description:**
This project is based on the Dota 2 Kaggle competition, which involves binary classification to predict the winner of a game using structured data. The dataset contains numerous game features such as player stats, hero selections, and game events. Key steps include data preprocessing (feature engineering and encoding), applying logistic regression and XGBoost models, and evaluating their performance using ROC AUC metrics. Additionally, an ensemble model using both Logistic Regression and XGBoost was implemented to further improve prediction accuracy.

**Skills:** 

- Data Engineering: Creating new features (gold difference, XP difference, etc.) from raw game data.
- Machine Learning: Implementing logistic regression with cross-validation, XGBoost, Ensemble modeling (VotingClassifier)
- Model Evaluation: Using performance metrics such as ROC AUC to assess model accuracy.
- Python Programming: Using libraries like pandas for data manipulation and scikit-learn for machine learning and model evaluation.
- Feature Scaling: Applying standardization techniques for preparing data for model training.

**Technology:** 

- pandas for data manipulation
- scikit-learn for machine learning models, scaling, and evaluation (LogisticRegressionCV, StratifiedKFold, StandardScaler)
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib (for ROC curve visualization)

**Results:**

he best model achieved a ROC AUC score of 0.8327 using XGBoost. The ensemble model (Voting Classifier) achieved a ROC AUC score of 0.8262.
Submission results were prepared for the Kaggle competition, predicting the probability of the Radiant team winning. I was 2nd in this [competition.](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dota-2-simplified/overview)
